            <p class="card-description">Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to define their importance and sequence within a web page. This IKEA page does a really good job of demonstrating that in two dimensions: text size and color. The three levels of text size naturally lead your eye from the attention-grabbing headline in large text, through the short description in medium-sized text designed to build interest, and on to the details in the fine print, so to speak. This is also achieved with a hierarchy of color where the bright red box around the headline reinforces that this is where you need to focus your attention on this page first. It's almost impossible to ignore the headline with such a powerful contrast between the bright red text box and the plain white page behind it.</p>

            <p class="card-description">White space is one of the most important design principles for a web site, and it refers to the areas between design elements. White space doesn't even need to be white. It can be implemented with various colors, textures, patterns, or even background images. It is important as it removes potential distractions and allows the reader to focus where the designer intends. Clean design goes hand in hand with white space as a primary design principle. It promotes simple, uncluttered layouts, and even drives the implementation of more white space on a page. The Pocket Penguins home page is a prime example of both excellent use of white space and very clean design. With almost no distractions on the page, you can't help but focus on the simple text and singular navigation buttons that guide your path through the site.</p>

            <p class="card-description">Contrast is the design principle that "refers to the juxtaposition of visually dissimilar elements in order to convey the fact that these elements are different" (Nielsen Norman Group). Color contrast is the most widely used type of contrast in web design. It's primary function is to make screen content accessible by enhancing text readability through a significant contrast with it's background. The Netflix home page is a perfect example of the use of color contrast to make text, navigation buttons, logos, and graphics more accessible by using bright colors that stand out against a darker background image. It's easy to be drawn to the bright white text against the dark background, and you'll have no problem executing the two primary actions the designers intended: signing in, or creating a new account.</p>
